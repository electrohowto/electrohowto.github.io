<p>A relay is an electromechanical switch that makes use of an <a href="inductor.htm">inductor coil</a> to move the switching contact.</p>
<p>The symbol for an SPDT relay looks like this:</p>

<p>Relays act like <a href="transistor.htm">transistors</a>, in that they have a switching portion and a control portion.</p>
<p>You can use a relay with a transistor, but be sure to use a flyback diode to protect your transistor!</p>
<p>Relays can be used on AC or DC, depending on which relay you get. AC relays are used in appliances, and DC relays are used in automotive, etc.</p>
