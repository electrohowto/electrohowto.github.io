<p>A capacitor stores a charge, almost like a battery, but weaker. Capacitance is measured in <b>farads</b> (F).</p>

<p>The symbol for a non-polarized capacitor looks like this:</p>

<p>The symbol for a polarized capacitor looks like this:</p>

<p>If you see this polarized version of the symbol in a schematic, the capacitor most likely has an electrolytic or tantalum-based dielectric.</p>
<p>Be sure to connect polarized capacitors the correct way or they'll explode!</p>
<p>Other capacitors, such as ceramic disc-type, can be connected either way. Just be sure to feed them a voltage at or under their limit; otherwise they'll explode.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let's say we have a 100&#181;F electrolytic capacitor rated for 16V...</p>
<ul>
<li>If we use a 5V signal generator on our capacitor, we should be fine provided it has been connected the correct polarity.</li>
<li>If we use a 9V battery, we're still okay.</li>
<li>An A23 battery (12V) won't even harm the capacitor! But...</li>
<li>If we use two 9V batteries, we destroy our capacitor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Capacitors can be used in many different ways, from altering the shape of a wave on the output of a 555 timer to smoothing out a DC power source for use with logic.</p>
<p>Capacitors can even be found paired with <a href="resistor.htm">resistors</a> in R-C low pass filters.</p>
