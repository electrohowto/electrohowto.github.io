<h1><p align="center">The Integrated Circuit (IC)</p></h1>
<p>An integrated circuit, or IC, is a device that combines many discrete components into a single chip.</p>
<p>The symbol for a 555 timer IC looks like this:</p>

<p>ICs come in a wide variety of styles, from simple timers, to seven-segment decoders, to programmable microcontrollers.</p>
<p>Many circuits can be <a href="build.htm">built</a> using ICs, including clocks, thermometers, and random number generators.</p>
<p>Without ICs, we would still be using <a href="transistor.htm">transistors</a> for our logic!</p>
<hr>
<p>For our main classes of ICs, there are two classes...</p>
<h2><p align="center">The 7400 Series</p></h2>
<p>These ICs use BJT transistors as the base for their logic, hence "transistor-transistor logic" (TTL).</p>
<p>The voltage on these ICs must not drop below or exceed 5V.</p>
<h2><p align="center">The 4000 Series</p></h2>
<p>These ICs use MOSFETs as the base of their logic, hence "complementary metal oxide semiconductor" (CMOS).</p>
<p>Their voltages must not exceed 15V. They're also sensitive to static electricity.</p>
