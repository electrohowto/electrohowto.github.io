<p>An LED, or light-emitting diode, is a component that emits light when a small voltage and current passes through it.</p>

<p>The symbol for an LED looks like this:</p>

<p>LEDs come in many different colors, from the classic red, to ultraviolet. Multicolor LEDs exist, too.</p>
<p>LEDs have a wide variety of uses, from a power on indicator to a pixel in a billboard.</p>
<p>To light an LED, you can use a simple 3V coin cell. But if you were to light an LED using a 9V battery, you would need a <a href="resistor.htm">resistor</a> to limit the current across the LED to prevent permanent damage.</p>
<p>If running an LED off of high voltages (140V for example), you'd need a power resistor big enough to handle the energy loss. A quarter-watt resistor would burn up in this application.</p>
