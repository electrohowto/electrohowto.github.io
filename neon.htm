<p>A neon lamp uses neon gas to light a cathode inside a glass bulb.</p>

<p>The symbol for a neon lamp looks like this:</p>

<p>Neon lamps, unlike LEDs, require a high voltage to light. They require at least 65V AC, or 90V DC, for the plain neon lamps. Colored neon lamps require higher voltages. See <a href="safety.htm">the safeguard page</a> for information on working with high voltage.</p>
<p>You'll find neon lamps in some older equipment as power indicators, and in most 120V illuminated power switches.</p>
<p>You can <a href="nightlight.htm">make your own night light</a> using a neon lamp and a 100K resistor.</p>
<hr>
<p>When working with neon lamps, on DC you'll notice only one cathode lights out of two. On AC, both cathodes light.</p>
