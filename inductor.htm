<h1><p align="center">The Inductor</p></h1>
<p>An inductor is a coil of wire that impedes the flow of electric current. The unit of measure for impedence is the <b>henry</b> (H).</p>

<p>The symbol for an inductor coil looks like this:</p>

<p>There are different types of inductive components, such as basic coils, solenoids, electromagnets, motors, transformers, and <a href="relay.htm">relays</a>.</p>
<p>You'll find inductor coils in power supplies. They aid in smoothing out AC ripple.</p>
<p>When controlling an inductor via a switch or <a href="transistor.htm">transistor</a>, you must include a <a href="diode.htm">diode</a> connected in reverse to prevent a voltage spike from destroying your switching device. This diode is known as a "flyback diode".</p>
