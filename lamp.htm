<h1><p align="center">The Incandescent Light Bulb</p></h1>
<p>An incandescent light bulb, or lamp, uses a filament to create light. This wastes a lot of power, and is not recommended for battery-powered circuits.</p>

<p>The symbol for a lamp looks like this:</p>

<p>Lamps, as mentioned, waste massive amounts of power in a circuit. This is because of their design; it's basically a thin wire shorted across two terminals.</p>
<p>Unlike LEDs, lamps can work on either polarity, but also unlike LEDs, they have a tendency to need replaced often.</p>
<p>Lamps come in a wide range of voltages, shapes, and sizes, ranging from 2.5V flashlight bulbs to 250V European appliance bulbs, and from the tiny T1.75 to the gargantuan PS-52.</p>
<p>Be wary of the wattage of your lamp! You could fry things if you choose too high power ratings.</p>
