<p>A Numitron is a display device that uses <a href="lamp.htm">incandescent</a> filaments as segments.</p>
<p>The Numitron comes in a tube, and usually has seven segments. Here is a real-life example:</p>

<p>Some old equipment of the 1970s would use these tubes to display information.</p>
<hr>
<p>To use a Numitron tube, place 3V on the common pin, and ground a segment. You can even switch the polarity, or run them off an AC square wave (like an LCD), since these tubes are essentially lamps!</p>
