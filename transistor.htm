<h1><p align="center">The Transistor</p></h1>
<p>A transistor acts as a switch in a circuit. It can be used to amplify signals, or to switch a signal on or off.</p>

<p>There are two types of transistors: NPN and PNP. The symbols for the two types of transistors look like this:</p>

<p>Transistors come in every shape and size imaginable, ranging from the common TO-92 package to the hefty TO-3 package.</p>
<p>You can find transistors in any digital circuit out there! Some even come with two in one package; these are known as Darlington transistors.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another type of transistor exists, too: the field-effect transistor (FET). These are different from standard bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) in that they're unipolar, and that their gates are voltage driven rather than current driven.</p>
<p>MOSFETs are a type of FET that can be driven up to 15V on the gate, rather than the 5V of the base of a transistor.</p>
<hr>
<p>When working with BJTs in a 12V circuit, it is wise to use a 100K <a href="resistor.htm">resistor</a> on the base to avoid destroying the internal diode from overcurrent.</p>
<p>MOSFETs will work fine on 12V. Be sure not to bring the MOSFET near any static electricity, though, or you will destroy the semiconductor.</p>
